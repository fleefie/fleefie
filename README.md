Hey, you may call me Fleefie.

Computer engineering student, too busy being at school or in a train to answer immediately. Mostly interested in embedded and systems programming.

Languages:
- 🔧 C
- 🗃️ C++
- 🦀 Rust
- ☕ (Learning) Java and Scala
- 🧙x86 and 🎮 GBZ80 Assembly
- 💩 Web languages, unfortunately (JS, TS, PHP).

My three wishes in tech:
- Normalize actually optimizing your code
- Delete every "web technology", without exceptions. It's raw, pure HTML and CSS or nothing!
- Make vim motions the standard
